QUESTION:
At price 1, i buy and sell 1 unit.
At price 2, i buy and sell 2 unit  (profit from buy unit 1, close buy at 1)
At price 3, i buy and sell 3 unit  (profit from buy unit 2, close buy at 2)
At price 5,  i buy and sell 5 unit  (profit from buy unit 3, close buy at 3)
At price 8, i buy and sell 8 unit  (profit from buy unit 5, close buy at 5)
....
Untill price is 89,  i buy and sell 89unit  (profit from buy unit 55, close buy at 55)
The max price is after the market reverse is for example 92 and reverse 25%- 30% (92-1) * 0.25 = 68.25, I close all of the orders. Calculate the profit for me 


ANSWER:
At each Fibonacci price, you place a buy and sell order equivalent to the Fibonacci number.
When the market rises to the next Fibonacci number, you close the previous buy order taking the profit.
This pattern continues until the price hits 92.
When the market reverses and hits approximately 68.25 (25% retracement from 92), you close all outstanding orders.
Given this scenario, let's calculate the profit from buy orders and the loss from the sell orders:

Buy Orders:
At price 2: Profit from 1 unit bought at price 1 = 1 unit.
At price 3: Profit from 2 units bought at price 2 = 2 units.
At price 5: Profit from 3 units bought at price 3 = 6 units.
At price 8: Profit from 5 units bought at price 5 = 15 units.
... This pattern continues ...
At price 89: Profit from 55 units bought at price 55 = 1,870 units.
Total Profit from Buy Orders = 1 + 2 + 6 + 15 + ... + 1,870 = 1,894 units.

Sell Orders:
The market reverses and hits 68.25. The loss on the sell orders:

Sell order at price 1: Profit of 67.25 units (because the market dropped).
Sell order at price 2: Profit of 66.25 units.
Sell order at price 3: Profit of 65.25 units.
Sell order at price 5: Profit of 63.25 units x 5 = 316.25 units.
... This pattern continues ...
Sell order at price 89: Loss of 20.75 units x 89 = 1,846.75 units (because the market didn't drop below 89).
Total Profit from Sell Orders = 67.25 + 66.25 + ... - 1,846.75

Net Profit/Loss:
Net = Total Profit from Buy Orders + Total Profit from Sell Orders.

To provide an accurate calculation, we need to sum up all the individual profits and losses from the sell orders. Given the nature of the Fibonacci sequence and the magnitude of the retracement, the sell orders from the lower Fibonacci numbers will be profitable, while the higher numbers (especially close to 89) will produce losses.

Let's calculate the sell order profits/losses:

Sell Order Profits:

1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 = 142 (from the Fibonacci numbers up to 55)

Sell Order Losses:

The biggest loss will be from the sell order placed at 89, which will be 20.75 units x 89 = 1,846.75

Given the nature of the Fibonacci sequence, the losses from the larger numbers will dominate, especially given that the biggest order (89 units) is at a substantial loss.

Net = 1,894 (profit from buy orders) - 1,846.75 (loss from sell orders at 89) + 142 (profits from sell orders up to 55)

Net = 189.25 units.

So, with the strategy you've outlined, and assuming the market behaves as described, your net profit would be 189.25 units.
